-- LearnLynk Tech Test - Task 2: RLS Policies on leads

alter table public.leads enable row level security;

-- Example helper: assume JWT has tenant_id, user_id, role.
-- You can use: current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::jsonb

-- TODO: write a policy so:
-- - counselors see leads where they are owner_id OR in one of their teams
-- - admins can see all leads of their tenant


-- Example skeleton for SELECT (replace with your own logic):

create policy "leads_select_policy"
on public.leads
for select
using (
  true
  -- TODO: add real RLS logic here, refer to README instructions
);

-- TODO: add INSERT policy that:
-- - allows counselors/admins to insert leads for their tenant
-- - ensures tenant_id is correctly set/validated
